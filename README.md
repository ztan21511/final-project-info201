## Project Proposal (AF6)
Ken Long, Yifeng Liu, Yinzi Wu, Zachary Tan
The main datasets we will be working with are Zillow Research, SPD Crime Data, County Clerk Records, Census demographic data, WalkScore, and Google Maps/Places to help us understand what factors affect real estate prices in Seattle. Zillow collects pricing and other housing related data as part of its business model as a real estate resource. WalkScore allows users to make a limited number of calls (5000/day) to their API, so we can try before we buy their service for a larger project. Google Maps/Places allows a limited number of API calls for some of their APIs on the same type of free trial model. Some resources are public record. SPD makes legally required data about crimes public, which allows other agencies and citizens to evaluate the work they're doing. County Clerk records provide information about what is happening in a city, with individuals and organizations. Census records help the government to identify the "state of the nation" (who they're serving) such as diversity, needs, progress, fairness/legality and seats in the House of Representatives.
Our stakeholders will be anyone who is, or will be home buyers, renters, property owners, developers and realtors. We might answer questions for our audience like: What most affects real estate prices in Seattle? What kind of changes in prices they expect to see? Is there a seasonal difference? For example, is renting in summer more expensive? Where will new development projects start? What might their property be worth in the future? Where should they buy (undeveloped) property?
We will make an interactive report as a website using Shiny or Leaflet. Some Zillow data and SPD Crime may be accessed by CSV file. Alternatively, REST APIs like Zillow, Socrata Open Data for Seattle, WalkScore, and Google Maps/Places will be in JSON. We will need to find keys to join datasets on, or use as search terms, generally this may be an address,  coordinates on the map or a parcel number. We may have to do some Extract-Transform-Load summary. Some values generated by machine learning algorithms may be stored, possibly using Firebase/FireStore/RT or Cloud SQL, or a local cache file on the hard-drive. The R-integratable Javascript library "leaflet" helps provide the spatial visualization needed. Using arcgisbinding from the R-ArcGIS Github repository we may be able to use to access geoportals/Desktop ArcGIS. R package glmnet help provide Polynomial Multiple Regression with LASSO algorithm implementations we can use to identify the most important factors or the relations between factors like transportation, convenience, safety, amenities, and current and historical estate prices, build models representing these relations, and then use this data to predict future price fluctuations. We could generate the data ahead of time, allowing the user to view a price heatmap over a region, or to select a location and make predictions for that specific location in near real-time. (See appendix for URLs).
Major challenges we may face are finding keys to integrate the datasets, making efficient usage of our API limits for those resources that have them, the learning curves on new libraries, and knowing what exactly the algorithms found in relations between factors and prices. If someone were to ask why the system made a specific prediction, we may be able to provide a list of the features considered, but not why those features appear to be the most important to people historically (to show correlation, but not causation, and not to the degree some regulations might require for independent decision making).
